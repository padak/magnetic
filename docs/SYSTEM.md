# US Family Trip Planner System Description

## Overview
The US Family Trip Planner is an intelligent travel planning system that uses a multi-agent architecture to help families plan and organize their trips within the United States. The system combines web scraping, API integrations, and AI-driven planning to create comprehensive travel itineraries.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Modern React application using TypeScript
- Chakra UI for consistent and accessible design
- React Router for navigation
- React Query for state management
- Form handling with React Hook Form
- Responsive design for all devices

#### 2. Backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
- FastAPI application with async support
- PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Alembic for database migrations
- Redis for caching and state management
- Comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI

#### 3. Agent System

##### WebSurfer Agent (Completed)
A sophisticated web interaction agent responsible for:
- Web scraping using Playwright
- API integrations:
  - Google Maps for route planning and location services

  - Amadeus for flight and hotel information
- Features:
  - Intelligent route optimization
  - Real-time weather monitoring
  - Flight tracking
  - Hotel search and comparison
  - Attraction recommendations
- Robust error handling and resource management

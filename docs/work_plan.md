- Project structure organized with src/magnetic layout
- Core dependencies installed including FastAPI and SQLAlchemy
- Basic configuration system implemented
- Git repository initialized with .gitignore
- Package installation configured with setup.py
- Docker development environment with PostgreSQL and Redis
- Docker containers successfully tested and running

### 1.2 Core Framework Implementation
- [x] Install and configure dependencies
- [x] Set up base configuration management
- [x] Implement logging system
- [x] Create basic error handling structure
- [x] Set up testing framework
- [x] Create health check endpoints

**Completed Framework Details:**
- Environment variable configuration implemented
- Logging system with file and console handlers
- Basic test structure with pytest
- Error handling for configuration validation
- FastAPI application with health check endpoints
- Docker environment health monitoring

### 1.3 Database and Storage Setup
- [x] Initialize database for development
- [x] Create basic data models
- [x] Create database migration system
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL in Docker
- [x] Set up Redis in Docker
- [ ] Implement file storage system
- [ ] Implement basic caching with Redis

**Completed Database Details:**
- PostgreSQL database initialized in Docker
- Core models created (Trip, ItineraryDay, Activity, Accommodation, Budget)
- Alembic migrations configured and initial migration applied
- Base model with common fields implemented
- Database health checks implemented

### 1.4 Agent System Implementation
- [x] Create base agent class
- [x] Implement task management system
- [x] Create orchestrator agent
- [x] Implement agent registration
- [x] Add task execution flow
- [x] Write agent system tests

**Completed Agent System Details:**
- Base agent class with state management
- Task and TaskLedger implementation
- Orchestrator agent with task delegation
- Agent registration and coordination
- Comprehensive test coverage for agent system

**Next Immediate Tasks:**
1. Implement Redis caching layer for agent state persistence
2. Begin WebSurfer agent implementation with Playwright
3. Create initial API endpoints for trip planning
4. Set up file storage system for document generation
5. Implement basic authentication system

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure Development

### Redis Caching Layer (Completed)
- ✅ Implement Redis cache service with async operations
- ✅ Create caching decorator for API endpoints
- ✅ Add comprehensive tests for cache functionality
- ✅ Integrate caching with FastAPI application
- ✅ Add health checks for Redis service

### WebSurfer Agent Development (Completed)
- ✅ Set up Playwright integration
- ✅ Implement web scraping capabilities
- ✅ Add API integration framework
- ✅ Create travel data collectors
- ✅ Add comprehensive tests
- ✅ Integrate with Orchestrator

## Current Status
The project has completed the foundation setup and implemented core infrastructure components including:
- Basic project structure and configuration
- Database models and migrations
- Docker development environment
- Redis caching layer with comprehensive testing
- Base agent system with orchestrator
- WebSurfer agent with web scraping and API integrations

## Next Steps
1. Develop the trip planning algorithms:
   - Implement destination research system
   - Create itinerary planning algorithm
   - Add budget management system
   - Implement activity scheduling
   - Create transportation planning

2. Implement the REST API endpoints:
   - Trip creation and management
   - Itinerary planning
   - Budget calculation
   - Document generation

3. Create the frontend interface:
   - Design and implement the user interface
   - Integrate with backend APIs
   - Ensure responsive design

4. Set up file storage system:
   - Configure S3-compatible storage
   - Implement file upload/download
   - Add document templates
   - Create PDF generation service

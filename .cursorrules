Use python virtual environment to run the code.

Use pip to install the dependencies via requirements.txt.

Use pip freeze > requirements.txt to freeze the dependencies.

Backend services (database, API) run in Docker containers. Use docker-compose for managing these services.

For database migrations, run alembic commands inside the appropriate Docker container.

Frontend development can be done locally using the virtual environment.

When you're done with some tangible task, commit the changes to the repository and also update work_plan.md.
